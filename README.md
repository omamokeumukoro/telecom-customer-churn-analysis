# Business Context: Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Background
The telecommunications company is facing increasing pressure in a highly competitive market. With multiple providers offering similar services and aggressive customer acquisition campaigns across the industry, customer retention has become critical to our profitability and long-term growth.

## The Problem
It has been observed a concerning trend in customer attrition over recent quarters. Acquiring new customers costs 5-7 times more than retaining existing ones, making churn a significant drain on resources and revenue. Each lost customer represents not only immediate revenue loss but also the forfeiture of potential lifetime value and the risk of negative word-of-mouth in the market.

## Business Impact
* **Revenue Loss**: Churned customers directly impact monthly recurring revenue and reduce customer lifetime value metrics
* **Acquisition Costs**: High churn rates force results to spending more on marketing and sales to maintain customer base size
* **Market Position**: Sustained churn weakens competitive position and market share
* **Investor Confidence**: Churn metrics are closely watched by stakeholders and impact company valuation

## Objective
There is a need to understand *why* customers are leaving and *who* is most likely to churn. This analysis will help:
1. **Identify at-risk customers** before they leave, allowing proactive intervention
2. **Understand churn drivers** to address root causes in service offerings, pricing, or customer experience
3. **Develop targeted retention strategies** tailored to different customer segments
4. **Optimize resource allocation** by focusing retention efforts where they'll have the greatest impact
5. **Improve customer lifetime value** by reducing attrition rates

## Key Business Questions
* Which customer segments have the highest churn rates?
* What service combinations or contract types correlate with lower churn?
* Are there early warning signs that predict churn risk?
* How do pricing and billing methods affect customer retention?
* What interventions could reduce churn in highest-risk segments?

## Success Metrics
The analysis will be considered successful if it enables the company to:
* Reduce overall churn rate by 15-20% within 6 months
* Identify the top 3-5 actionable drivers of churn
* Create a predictive model to flag at-risk customers with 75%+ accuracy
* Develop segment-specific retention strategies with clear ROI projections
